### What I learned

learnt that multiple background images can be added and can be positioned using background-position property.
```css
html{
  background-image: url(../images/bg-pattern-top-mobile.svg), url(../images/bg-pattern-bottom-mobile.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
  background-position: left top, right bottom;
}
```

### Continued development

Still there is lot of repetition in the css code, will try to clean it up in future.
